# monescript

monescript is a double-entry [plain text accounting](http://plaintextaccounting.org/) system that works in you browser. 
monescript is a server-less application, all the calculations are performed locally in your browser window without any data 
leaving your computer. 

monescript works with text files formatted as a transaction journal. No modification is made to the original journal, monescript 
only performs journal analysis and presents financial summary graphs and statistics.

# Motivation

For years I've been using Excel to handle my personal accounting. After stumbiling upon [Ledger docs](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html) and 
[introduction to double-entry accounting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/100tGcA4blh6KSXPRGCZpUlyxaRUwFHEvnz_k9DyZFn4/edit)
from [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) I decided to try out plain text accounting. 

Around that time I also wanted to learn JavaScript, so naturally monescript works in the browser and in nodejs (for the tests). As a side benefit 
there is nothing to install to get monescript working, all you need is a browser and a text editor. You can just add your transactions to the text file and 
open it in [monescript](https://monescript.github.io/) to get all the details in couple of clicks. 
  
## [Demo](https://monescript.github.io/)
By default demo shows randomly generated data on the Transactions tab. 

You can explore the generated journal format on the Source tab.

If you have a file with monescript journal syntax you can feed it to monescript from the Open tab. 

## monescript journal syntax

monescript syntax is inspired by [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org) journal syntax. Here is the list of
features that are currently supported by monescript parser:

- Transaction format
  - YYYY-MM-DD date format
  - BTC currency
  - simple arithmetic value expressions (+, -, *, /)
  - notes prefixed with ';'
- line comments prefixed with ';' or '#'
- bucket command
- tag names
- include and year commands (ignored)

There is no restriction on the name of the accounts. 

Journal is expected to be balanced, which means that for every transaction has to have source and destination account(s). 
if journal is not balanced. monescript will not be able to analyze the journal and show an error.

### Sample monescript journal file


```` 
bucket Assets:Bank:Checking 

2017/1/9 * The Doughnut
  Expenses:Food:Takeout                  BTC10.10
  Assets:Bank:Checking 

2017/1/7 * Pharmacy One
  Expenses:Pharmacy                      BTC22.34
# don't have to specify the source account, when defined with bucket command above  

2017/2/1 * PartyShack
  ; monescript can compute simple expressions, like this tax calculation 
  Expenses:Entertainment                 (BTC5.89 * 1.05) 
  Expenses:Clothing                      BTC16.72
  Assets:Bank:Checking 

; You can insert arbitrary comments between transactions
2017/1/13 * Groceries and More
  Expenses:Food:Grocery                  BTC29.32 ; Or for each posting
  Assets:Bank:Checking 

2017/2/3 * Laser Play
